<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Introduction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The following literature review discusses current and seminal research on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions operations, specifically fractions multiplication and division. This</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">review builds on a previous literature review of the foundations of fractions,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foundations to Learning and Teaching Fractions: Addition and Subtraction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Literature Review (Bruce, Chang, Flynn &amp; Yearley, 2013). This operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">literature extends beyond the foundations review to offer new insights into</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the challenges of understanding fractions operations, specifically</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division, and promising teaching practices that support</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students in a deep understanding of these procedures and their conceptual</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">underpinnings. This document begins by outlining the methods used to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conduct the literature review and then provides a comprehensive discussion</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the central themes and key issues identified in the research to date on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions multiplication and division.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Review Methods</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To develop this document, a comprehensive literature review examining</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">research on multiplication and division of fractions was completed. Relevant</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">articles were retrieved, read and summarized. A database of reviewed articles</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was created and includes article citations, abstracts, brief summaries and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">additional notes (see appendix). Articles were selected from literature searches</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">using the key words: “Fractions Operations,” “Fractions and Multiplication,”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Fractions and Division,” “Fractions and Multiplications and Division,” and</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 8 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Overview</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions are relational representations that can be perceived as continuous or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discreet quantities, and are an integral part of our everyday lives from birth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The emphasis on whole number counting at an early age tends to reinforce a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strong concept of numbers as whole numbers. When students are then, much</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">later, introduced to non-integer number types such as fractions, they may find</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it difficult to transition to thinking about a continuous system or quantities</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that vary from „the whole‟. “Research indicates that children have difficulty</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">integrating fractions into their already well-established understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole numbers (Staflyidou &amp; Vosniadou, 2004; Vamvakoussi &amp; Vosniadou,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2010; Ni &amp; Zhou, 2005), and even adults at community colleges seem to lack</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fundamental understanding of how to use fractions (Stigler et. al., 2010)”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(DeWolf, Bassok &amp; Holyoak, 2013, p. 389).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If foundational concepts and understanding of fractions are not addressed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effectively, the groundwork is not in place for further manipulation of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions and fractions ideas, such as considering operations contexts and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">procedures. Multiplication and division of fractions has proven to be a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">particularly difficult area to both teach and learn. This difficulty is also related</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the complexity of fractions themselves as a „multifaceted construct‟. Further,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">student misunderstandings of the meaning behind algorithmic „shortcuts‟ with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions, can lead to later problems in other areas of mathematics, such as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">algebra.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this literature review, we begin by examining research on the conceptual</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">underpinnings of multiplication and division with fractions. We then identify</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the current prevailing strategies for teaching multiplication and division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions and the related common student and teacher misconceptions. We</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">then outline some of the more effective models and promising practices for </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 9 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teaching multiplication and division with fractions. In the final section we offer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some recommendations for consideration and further discussion. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Conceptual Underpinnings of Multiplication and Division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with Fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiplication and division with fractions is more complex than whole number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division (Lamon, 1999). When we consider that, in addition</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the many interpretations of multiplication or division, there are also five</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meanings/interpretations of fractions depending on the context, we can see</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">how complex these operations are for students. (The five subconstructs - or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meanings of fractions, including part-whole, part-part, operator, quotient, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">measure - are outlined in detail in the Foundations to Learning and Teaching</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions: Addition and Subtraction Literature Review, Bruce et al., 2013, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discussed elsewhere in the current literature review.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is important to understand what is occurring when we multiply two</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions. In an area (array) model, we consider multiplication as the shared</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">space of two numbers. In whole numbers, the shared space of 3 columns and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6 rows is 18 cells (3 x 6 = 18). With fractions, we can also think about the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shared space using a partitioned area model. Important for the discussion of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction division models below, the product of length x width (or AxB) can</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also be called a Cartesian product. In a fractions example, the shared space of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the area and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the area is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">18</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the whole area (</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">x</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">=</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">18</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">). This is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">illustrated in the following diagram:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 1 Area model of whole number multiplication</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Figure 2 Area model of multiplication of fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the area model, whole number multiplication by skip counting</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can be adapted for fraction multiplication. Consider the following example of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole number skip counting (or repeated addition: 3+3+3+3+3+3 =18, or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6x3 =18:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For fractions, the line can run from 0 to 1 and the unit fraction can be used</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for repeated addition. Thinking about 18 units partitioned equally means that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">each jump of 3 is one sixth (the unit). In this example, we are now adding, or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">counting by, one-sixth units: 1 one-sixth, 2 one-sixths, 3 one-sixths, 4 onesixths,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5 one-sixths, 6 one-sixths. This is the same as or at least similar to 6x</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition to the models described above, which apply to both division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole numbers and with fractions, there are two strategies that relate</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">specifically to the division of fractions: division as the determination of the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unit rate and division as the inverse of multiplication (Sinicrope, Mick &amp; Kolb,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">p. 153).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like Sinicrope, Mick and Kolb (2002), Yim (2010) considered the first three</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strategies for division of fractions in a study of 10- and 11-year-olds. A review</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of previous work on the division of fractions indicated that there was</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">extensive research into the measurement and partitive models of division, as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">described above, but not as much on the product-and-factors model (“the </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 17 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inverse of a Cartesian product”). The study, therefore, focused on the latter in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an effort to better understand the inverse of a Cartesian product model</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(finding the missing dimension of a rectangular area) using pictorial</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">procedures like the one shown above. Most of the students in the study were</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">able to develop strategies for creating pictorial procedures. Strategies</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">included converting either a dimension or the area to 1 (i.e. working with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">friendly numbers), which involves building on prior knowledge of proportional</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thinking about the area of a rectangle, as well as prior knowledge of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and addition of fractions. Yim concluded that solving division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems in this way should prove helpful for students to better understand</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the meaning of fraction division algorithms (p. 119).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lamon (1999) considered the operators that underlie fraction multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and division in her book on teaching fractions for understanding. She</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recognizes the challenges in multiplying and dividing fractions as she</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">describes both multiplication and division of fractions as the composition of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two operators (e.g., in multiplication, one combines two fractions: „</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of (</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An area model is helpful in illustrating this way of thinking about</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication. To solve this problem, a rectangle (the whole) would be divided</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, the same rectangle (the whole) would be divided into thirds. Two thirds</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Informal knowledge students bring to fractions: the case of equal sharing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equal sharing is an essential concept that underlies multiplication and division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with fractions. Equal sharing involves dividing something into equal parts, for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example, breaking a cookie into equal halves to share between two people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 20 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even very young children are able to share equally and recognize when</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something has been shared unfairly, or unequally. Some researchers maintain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that fractions appear to be largely intuitive for very young children, who have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">experience and familiarity with – and curiosity about – the quantities between</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole numbers (Nora Newcombe, Personal communication, August 2014).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Studies show, for example, that the ability to understand fractions as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplicative structures stems from equal sharing problems, much like in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">partitive division, as discussed above (Empson, Junk, Dominguez &amp; Turner,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2006). “Findings show that children‟s attempts to make sense of equal sharing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">elicited relationships among fractions, ratio, multiplication, and division,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">evidenced in how children share things exhaustively and equally among</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sharers” (pp. 23-24). Learning fractions often begins with equal sharing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems, where students divide up a certain amount of something among a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">certain number of friends (Empson, 2001). In these types of problems,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students will spontaneously create examples of fraction equivalence, as they</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“naturally move toward the goal of partitioning or transforming shares into</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the biggest possible pieces” (p. 421). For example, in the equal sharing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem „24 children share 8 pancakes equally,‟ students were observed to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">divide each pancake into 24 equal parts (using the smallest pieces), but then</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">considered how they could distribute the largest possible pieces amongst the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">group, (e.g., recognizing 24 as a multiple of 8 meant students partitioned</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pancakes into thirds) a direct application of fraction equivalence (Empson,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2001, p. 421).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Procedural vs. conceptual approaches</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often in classrooms in North America, procedural approaches to operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with fractions are emphasized over conceptual approaches (see Hasemann,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1981; this is also further discussed in Section 4 on student challenges and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">misconceptions). A procedural approach involves learning rules for </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 21 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">manipulating the symbolic notation in order to produce an answer. Procedural</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge can be defined as “„know how to do it‟ knowledge” (McCormick,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1997, p. 143) or as the “action sequences for solving problems.” (RittleJohnson</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&amp; Alibali, 1999, p. 175). A conceptual approach, on the other hand,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provides students with the means to explore the meaning of the operation on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a conceptual level, often involving exploration with hands-on materials.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conceptual knowledge can be defined as “relationships among „items‟ of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge” (McCormick, 1997, p. 143) or as “explicit or implicit understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the principles that govern a domain and of the interrelations between</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pieces of knowledge in a domain” (Rittle-Johnson &amp; Alibali, 1999, p. 175).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forrester and Chinnappan (2010) consider the differences between</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">approaching a fraction multiplication problem procedurally and approaching it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conceptually. A procedural approach to solving a problem would be to simply</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiply the numerators together, multiply the denominators together and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">simplify. A conceptual approach would involve partitioning or cutting an area</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into a certain number of parts to find x of y (p. 187). Their study found that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pre-service teachers mainly relied on the procedural approach, which led to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">errors and an inability to catch and correct mistakes. In other words, this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">research (along with many other studies discussed throughout this literature</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">review) shows that an understanding of the concepts underlying multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and division with fractions outlined above is beneficial for deep understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of concepts, as well as application and retention of procedures. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Current Teaching Strategies for Multiplication and Division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with Fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to better understand the challenges students commonly face in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">learning to multiply and divide with fractions, we need to understand how</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division with fractions are commonly presented in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">classrooms in North America. The literature – although slim – reveals some</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prevalent trends, including an emphasis on procedures over concepts; an</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">emphasis on the part-whole meaning of fractions (combined with a lack of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">explicit attention to other meanings); limited use of representations of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division with fractions; as well as insufficient instructional</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Privileging Procedures</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without conceptual understanding, students may be merely engaging in the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“meaningless following of rules of calculation” (Keijzer &amp; Terwel, 2001, p. 55).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiplication and division with fractions typically involves all sorts of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">procedural and rule-based actions, such as “invert and multiply” (Rule &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hallagan, 2006). Many have noted that, while conceptualizing multiplication of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions is difficult, the algorithms are relatively simple to memorize and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">apply. However, appropriate application of the algorithm does not mean a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">student understands the process; the traditional invert-and-multiply algorithm,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for example, doesn‟t require an understanding of the processes behind</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division of fractions. (This rule also loses sight of the role of the divisor, an</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">important piece that is often overlooked, according to Coughlin (2010); when</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">solving word problems, for example, interpreting the solution requires</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reference to the divisor, since a remainder without reference to the divisor is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meaningless.) Students who do not understand the reasoning behind the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">procedure may not always be able to apply it successfully or always know</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when to use it (Tsankova &amp; Pjanic, 2009), and will eventually struggle when </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 23 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">simply being able to follow the rule becomes insufficient (when solving more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">complex fraction problems, for example) (Wu, 2001).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is evidence in the research that teachers tend to focus instruction on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">procedures for multiplying and dividing fractions, with less attention to the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concepts underlying these procedures (how the procedures act on the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractional quantities and the reasoning behind the operations and/or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">algorithms themselves) (Baroody &amp; Hume, 1991; Li, 2008; Petit, Laird &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marsden, 2010; Phillip, 2000; Rule &amp; Hallagan, 2006). This has been attributed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to at least two issues: First, research indicates that effectively teaching the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">underlying concepts is more challenging and requires a deeper content</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding than teaching the rules alone (Vale and Davies, 2007). And</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">second, researchers have found that even when teachers possess solid</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">content knowledge and conceptual understanding themselves, prospective</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers struggled to represent fractions conceptually (with pictures, diagrams</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or in word problems) (Lo and Luo, 2012). Thus the problem is multi-layered</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and requires systematic opportunities for teacher professional learning in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">order to support teachers in developing effective strategies and models for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">representing fractions concepts in ways that are meaningful and helpful to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their students.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cultural Differences in Curricula for Teaching Fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Analyses of curricula (in the form of textbook content) also help to document</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">common approaches to the teaching of multiplication and division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions, including cultural differences. Son &amp; Senk (2010) set out to perform</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a comparative analysis of curricula from South Korea and the USA. They cite a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">great deal of research indicating that grade 4-8 students in Asian countries,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">including South Korea, outperform students in economically similar European</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and North American countries. Textbooks from each country were analysed to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">assess the differences in the presentation of multiplication and division of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions. The analysis revealed a significantly higher number of lessons and </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 24 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems on the division of fractions in the Korean curriculum than the US</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one; there seems to be more instructional time spent on multiplication and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions in Korea. Another difference is in the development of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“conceptual understanding and procedural fluency” (p. 119). The researchers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">found that in the US curricula, instruction focuses on conceptual</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding separately from procedural fluency (e.g., the algorithms for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division), whereas in the Korean curriculum, the two are</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">developed simultaneously. This study also found that American curricula had</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">limited focus on the different meanings of multiplication and division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions (“the meaning of multiplication of fractions mainly as finding a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">portion of a portion and division of fractions solely using the measurement or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">repeated subtraction interpretation”) (p. 134). In contrast, the Korean curricula</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uncovered and addressed multiple meanings of each operation. These</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">observations are particularly interesting given that Korea has been reported to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have higher mean achievement than the US. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 25 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Student Challenges and Misconceptions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Learning fractions, in general, is a serious challenge and obstacle in the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“mathematical maturation of children” (Charalambous &amp; Pitta-Pantazi, 2007:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">293). Multiplication and division with fractions remains an area of struggle for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students across populations in North America; for example, a study focusing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on students with learning disabilities from junior-high to high school found</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that deficits in fraction terminology and basic fraction operations were both in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the top 6 most frequently reported problem areas (McLeod &amp; Armstrong,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1982). Although this study is now over 30 years old, current research,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discussed below, concurs with the findings of McLeod and Armstrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is understanding operations with fractions so difficult?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To answer this question, we must look at the difficulties students have with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions overall. Hasemann (1981), for example, compared the challenge of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding operations with fractions to performing operations with whole</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">numbers in a study of students aged 12 to 15 in Germany. Hasemann points</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out that fractions are more challenging because they are used far less often,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the written notation of fractions is more complex. In addition, ordering</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and comparing fractions (e.g., along a number line) is more difficult because</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are considering multiple digits (numerator and denominator) that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">represent one single quantity. Further, when fractions are involved in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations, the rules and algorithms are more complicated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Further to these complexities, fractions also possess several meanings (known</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the research as “subconstructs”) depending on their context and use,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">namely part-whole, part-part, operator, quotient, and measure (see Bruce et</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">al., 2013, for more detailed information). Often the different meanings of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions are not made explicit to students; in general, instruction in North</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">American classrooms dwells particularly on the part-whole construct (Moseley</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 26 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&amp; Okamoto, 2008; Moseley, 2005). Charalambous &amp; Pitta-Pantazi (2007)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked at differences in over 600 fifth- and sixth-grade student understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of each of the fractions subconstructs and how this understanding affected</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">student performance on operations with fractions as well as determining</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractional equivalents. Their findings show that students are most proficient in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part-whole subconstruct tasks and least proficient in measure-related tasks</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">such as comparing fractions, ordering fractions, placing fractions on number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lines and finding equivalent fractions using number lines (p. 302-304). This is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not surprising given the typically strong focus on the part-whole construct in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction teaching.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Student development of fractions subconstructs is a complex phenomenon. In</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a qualitative study of sixth-grade students, Hackenburg and Tillema (2009)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recognize the changes in difficulty level of fraction multiplication questions;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">difficulty depends on the type of fractions being multiplied (e.g., a unit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction vs. a proper fraction, and in which order they are multiplied –</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">calculating a unit fraction of a proper fraction or a proper fraction of a unit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction) (p. 16).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their chapter, “Understanding Operations on Fractions and Decimals,”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Empson and Levi (2011) discuss the particular conceptual challenges students</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">face when learning multiplication and division of fractions. Multiplication and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division involve unfamiliar concepts when numbers involved in the question</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are fractions (especially when a fraction is being multiplied by a fraction,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instead of a fraction by a whole number). Empson and Levi (2011) call these</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">types of questions “partial groups problems”, as the number of groups is a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction, or partial number, and not a whole number and, therefore, involves</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">different procedures than those students are familiar with in whole number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division. When multiplying and dividing with partial</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">numbers, students must develop a conceptual understanding of new</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">algorithms. As Empson and Levi (2011) explain, “These problems pose new </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 27 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conceptual challenges, because they involve working with parts of parts and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">relating a part to two different units” (p. 189). One example these authors</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provide is the following problem: I have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a bag of candy. A full bag of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">candy weighs</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pound. How many pounds of candy do I have? To solve this</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem successfully, students need to cognitively consider</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of 1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pound and the same amount of candy is both</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a bag and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a pound”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(p. 189).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like Lamon (1999) and Empson &amp; Levi (2011), Graeber and Tirosh (1990)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">consider the conceptual misunderstandings and overgeneralizations that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students hold around multiplication and division. In the case of decimals for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example, which are deeply connected to fractions as another system for nonwhole</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">numbers, this international study (involving the United States and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Israel) revealed the assumptions that fourth and fifth graders brought to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division with decimals. They identified the student notion</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that multiplication always results in a bigger number and division in a smaller</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number, as a problematic belief that impeded an accurate understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">decimals, and in turn, of fractions operations (Graeber &amp; Tirosh, 1990).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Related to this misunderstanding is the challenge for students of managing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the nuanced meanings of mathematical notation, when some familiar</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conventions with operations involving whole numbers suddenly mean</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something different. For example, when multiplying whole numbers, the “x”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">symbol is often interpreted as repeated addition, but when multiplying</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions, it represents taking one amount “of” another (e.g.,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">). Student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">learning and flexibility with these conventions presents a significant challenge</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many researchers have noted the widespread difficulty that students have in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">attaining the concepts involved in multiplication and division with fractions</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conceptual understanding in this area has wide and serious implications that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">extend to other areas of mathematics (Baroody &amp; Hume, 1991).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the obvious long-term implications of student memorization of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">algorithms without understanding is the potential of large and unreasonable</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">errors that go unchecked. Hasemann (1981) describes these computational</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">errors as “nonsensical results” (p. 81) attributable to a lack of reasoning or</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meaning behind the algorithm. When students are able to understand the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">underlying concepts, on the other hand, they are able to better handle</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">increasing complexity and to apply the reasoning behind the algorithm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flexibly and with greater accuracy (Baroody &amp; Hume, 1991; Petit, Laird &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marsden, 2010).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A second long-term implication is revealed by Brown and Quinn (2007), who</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discuss the deep connections between fractions multiplication and division,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and algebra. Their study compared 191 students in the areas of algebra and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions competency. They found that student understanding of fraction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge was clearly linked (statistically significant) to algebraic reasoning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Elementary algebra is built on a foundation of fundamental arithmetic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concepts” (p. 8). In other words, algebraic concepts are similar to and rely on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions concepts. The rational number system, for example, is introduced in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">early algebra and draws upon an understanding of the common fraction (p.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8). When „shortcuts‟ such as to „simply cross multiply‟ when dividing fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are misunderstood or simply not connected to the reasoning of the actions,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students can have difficulty with more complex algebra later on. As Brown </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 29 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Quinn state, “the list of algebraic generalisations that rely on fractional</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">constructs grows as students move to each subsequent level of mathematics”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(p. 8). These generalizations include combining like terms (either of a unit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction or of a variable) and multiplying by a constant to simplify (to either</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clear a fraction‟s denominator or clear a variable). The implications of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">experiencing problems in algebra are serious, as algebra has been identified</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as a key precursor to later mathematics learning: “If algebra is for everyone,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">then all students must first become familiar and fluent with fractions” (Brown</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&amp; Quinn, 2007, p. 12). Gaining a solid understanding of the connected</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concepts and procedures related to multiplication and division with fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is, therefore, extremely important to later success in mathematics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 30 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Teaching Challenges</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a significant amount of content knowledge required in the successful</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teaching of multiplication and division with fractions. Teachers themselves</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">must not only understand how to multiply and divide fractions (procedural</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding), but they must have a sufficient conceptual understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations in order to successfully teach the concepts. Izsák (2008)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">emphasizes the necessity of in-depth understanding of the content in order</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be able to respond flexibly and effectively to the great range of student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">responses. Students benefit when teachers are able to adapt to a variety of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">student needs: “teachers need to reason explicitly and flexibly with nested</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">levels of units if they are to respond to the variety of quantitative structures…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that their students might assemble” (p. 104). Izsák‟s study highlights the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">importance of “explicit, flexible attention” (p. 139) to the range of student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">responses and what these responses imply or foreshadow in terms of student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding or lack thereof. Given the systemic underdevelopment of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions understanding in students and adults in North America, it is not</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">surprising that teachers face tremendous challenges in responding flexibly and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effectively to the range of student needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pre-service Teaching</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">General Challenges</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of the research on teaching challenges related to multiplication and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions reports on issues that pre-service teachers face, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that these issues are not unlike those of younger students. Graeber, Tirosh &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Glover (1989) found that pre-service teachers did, in fact, follow “primitive”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">models of multiplication and division and experienced difficulties with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">selecting the appropriate operation when solving word problems. A much</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more recent study of pre-service elementary teachers‟ procedural and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conceptual knowledge of fractions in Flanders also found that the </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 31 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">misconceptions and understandings of teachers mirror those of elementary</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">school students (Van Steenbrugge, Lesage, Valcke &amp; Desoete, 2014). In</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">general, pre-service teachers‟ knowledge of fractions was limited: teachers in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">both the first year and third year of their program made many errors when</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tested on procedural and conceptual knowledge of fractions in this study. The</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">authors argue that their work “provides ground to address teachers‟</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">preparation as an effective way to increase standards expected of students</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[student teachers]” (p. 156).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lack of Understanding of a Fraction as a Number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another particular similarity between student and pre-service teacher gaps in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding appears to rest with understanding fractions as quantities. In</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their study of pre-service teachers, Park, Güçler &amp; McCrory (2013) review</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">literature on K-8 students, and note that both K-8 students and pre-service</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers have difficulty “conceiving of fractions as numbers as an extension of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole numbers…” (p. 458). In the analysis of lessons and resulting student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concept attainment, the study showed that, “key mathematical aspects of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraction, including fraction-as-number, were not explicitly addressed” (p. 475).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was assumed that fraction-as-number was already understood by preservice</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers, and was therefore not addressed in the mathematics courses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The authors argue the importance of being “aware that understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions as numbers is not trivial either to mathematicians in the past or to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">today‟s K-8 students” (p. 477).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lack of Concept Understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many studies that examine pre-service teachers‟ mathematical content</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge demonstrate that this knowledge may be insufficient for effective</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teaching of multiplication and division with fractions (Izsák, 2008; Lubinski, Fox</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&amp; Thomason, 1998; Olanoff, 2011; Ball, 1990; Tobias, Olanoff and Lo, 2012). In</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their review of fractions research, Tobias, Olanoff and Lo (2012) found that </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 32 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pre-service teachers had an underdeveloped proficiency in fractions, and in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">later algebra (p. 668). In particular, the studies reviewed by Tobias, Olanoff</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Lo (2012) demonstrate that pre-service teachers tend to: “have a rulebased</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conception of fraction multiplication and division” (p. 671); and have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“misconceptions [that] result from overgeneralized rules from other number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">systems, such as multiplication always makes bigger, or result from not</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding algorithms for multiplying and dividing fractions” (p. 671). In</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their study of Taiwanese pre-service teachers‟ knowledge of fractions, Huang,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Liu &amp; Lin (2008) also found that these aspiring teachers showed better</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding of fractions procedures than fractions concepts, and had the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">most difficulty with operations (multiplication and division). Similarly, Forrester</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Chinnappan (2010) found that pre-service teachers in Australia mainly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">relied on procedures rather than conceptual understanding, which led to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">errors of their own, as well as an inability to catch and correct student errors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Challenges of Division with Fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Newton (2008) found that student teachers “were most uncertain about</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dividing fractions, followed by subtracting, multiplying, and adding fractions”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(p. 1100). Other researchers have attempted to delve into this phenomenon to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">investigate further the particular difficulty with division with fractions. Ball</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(1990), for example, interviewed prospective teachers to assess their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding of division by zero (e.g., 7 † 0 = ?) and division of fractions in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">algebraic equations. Many of the pre-service teachers were able to arrive at</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">correct answers, but few could explain the foundational principals and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meanings of division. Qualitative data in the study highlighted gaps in content</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge; one teacher candidate “seemed to get stuck by his knowledge of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the algorithm „invert and multiply‟” (p. 136); another explained “that she</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hadn‟t done this since high school” (p. 136). Ball conjectured that “The</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prospective teachers‟ knowledge of division seemed founded more on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">memorization than on conceptual understanding. Some of the teacher </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 33 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">candidates could not remember the rules at all… Sheer memorization serves</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">well to display mathematical knowledge in school – until one forgets, that is”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(p. 141-142).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To identify the precise issues pre-service teachers were having with the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division operation of fractions, Isik &amp; Kar (2012) conducted a case study</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">analysis of error type among pre-service elementary mathematics teachers in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Turkey. Seven types of errors were identified: unit confusion; assigning natural</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number interpretations to fractions; problems using ratio proportions; being</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unable to establish part-whole relationships; dividing by the denominator of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the divisor; using multiplication instead of division; and increasing errors by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inverting and multiplying the divisor fraction (p. 2-7). Further, the pre-service</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers in the study lacked sufficient understanding to pose division of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions problems that would benefit student learning, and may even have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">further contributed to student challenges. Given the abundance of research</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on pre-service teacher understanding of fractions, it is highly likely that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">increased attention on fractions understanding in teacher education programs</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would benefit these aspiring teachers and their future students (Luo, Lo &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leu, 2011; Lin et al., 2013).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In-service Teaching</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Research on in-service teachers was far less abundant compared to that of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pre-service teachers and suggests that there is a need for additional studies</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that identify the role and impact of in-service-level professional learning</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs on teacher content understanding and related teaching practices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One small but hopeful study (Flores, Turner &amp; Bachmann, 2005) of two inservice</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers focused on building teacher conceptual understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions and resulted in the development of a very precise</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sequence of types of fractions division questions to use with students. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 34 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although it is unclear as to whether this sequence has been field-tested more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">widely, it is worthy of consideration:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Use fractions with the same denominator, so that the first is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bigger than the second, and the quotient is a whole number;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for example,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">†</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. With the same conditions, but the quotient does not have to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be a whole number:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">†</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Use fractions that do not have the same denominator but that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are well known, are related, and have common factors, such as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">†</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">†</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">. With these examples, we want the children to find, by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">using manipulatives, the common denominator. What smaller</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">piece will fit into the two fractions?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Now with more difficult examples, as with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">†</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">. They also</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">need to be able to find the common denominator.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Ask students how we obtain the answer, look at the numbers,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and search for patterns and similarities:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. Effective Strategies for Teaching Multiplication and Division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with Fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although there is a limited amount of published research on teacher</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge of multiplication and division of fractions, there is a more robust</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">literature on best practices. Effective strategies for teaching described in the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">research literature clustered around six key areas, as follows:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1) Increase the focus on conceptual understanding;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2) Recognize and draw on students‟ informal knowledge and prior</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">experiences;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3) Draw on student familiarity with whole number operations;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4) Include multiple representations to convey meaning;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5) Specific suggestions for improving understanding of multiplication with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6) Specific suggestions for improving understanding of division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each of these themes is elaborated upon in the discussion below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effective teaching of fractions operations includes an increased focus on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conceptual understanding</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Research shows that student learning in multiplication and division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions benefits from attention to conceptual understanding before or in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conjunction with algorithms (Baroody and Hume, 1991; Li, 2008; Petit, Laird &amp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marsden, 2010; Phillip, 2000; Rule &amp; Hallagan, 2006): “Students need to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">develop number and operation sense before learning how to apply these</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">terms through procedures, understanding what the problem means, rather</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than merely computing an answer” (Rule &amp; Hallagan, 2006, p. 3). Li (2008) reiterates</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that it is not enough to teach only the invert-and-multiply algorithm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when teaching division of fractions; it is necessary for students to understand </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 36 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concepts beyond memorizing the rote calculations. In Li‟s Chinese textbook</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example, students are introduced to the meaning of fraction division (e.g., “as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the inverse operation of fraction multiplication through a discussion of three</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">related word problems”) before being taught the algorithm (p. 549).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baroody and Hume (1991) offer a developmental perspective to instruction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that draws on student strengths and prior knowledge and focuses on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meaning and understanding. They report that instruction should focus on:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding, informal knowledge, purposeful learning, reflection and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discussion (pp. 55-56). When learning fractions operations, Baroody and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hume (1991) suggest starting with context problems, so students can focus</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on what they are solving instead of how they are solving. When solving</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Informal knowledge is prior, “real-life circumstantial” knowledge that a student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can draw upon when solving problems (Mack, 1990, p. 16). Studies show that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students do indeed have informal knowledge of fractions, but that they lack</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an understanding of algorithmic procedures and fraction symbols (p. 29). “The</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">results add more evidence to the argument in favor of teaching concepts</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prior to procedure” (Mack, 1990, p. 30). Mack (2001) considered ways to build</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on fifth grade students‟ informal knowledge of multiplication with fractions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Partitioning and unit fractions are two examples of prior knowledge identified</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the study. Students benefit from having a flexible understanding of the unit</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and determining what constitutes the whole when learning to multiply</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions and thinking about finding “a part of a part of a whole” (p. 269). The</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fifth graders in Mack‟s study (2001) also continuously drew upon their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge of partitioning when they worked on solving increasingly complex</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication problems. Students reconceptualized and partitioned units to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reflect the different multiplication problems they were given and adjusted</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their strategies based on the “relationship they perceived between the</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mathematical concepts, like ratio, reciprocals, inverse operations,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication, proportional reasoning and algebra. Inevitably, students</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">approach division of fractions with previous knowledge of division, and it is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">important to optimize this prior knowledge. Equivalent fractions, multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and division of whole numbers, and multiplication of fractions are identified,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by Flores, as important areas to draw upon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effective teaching of fractions multiplication and division should build</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from student familiarity with whole number operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Petit, Laird and Marsden (2010) note that connections to prior knowledge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about whole number operations can be powerful for students during</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instruction on multiplication and division with fractions. While operations with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions certainly carry “new and different interpretations” compared with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations with whole numbers (Wu, 2001, p. 174), many processes that apply</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to whole numbers do still apply to fractions. The examples given by Petit,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Laird and Marsden (2010) include the fact that one times a number will equal</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that number; 0 times a number will equal zero; and that multiplication and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division are the inverse of each other. Specifically, students should “interact</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with a variety of situations and contexts that include both partitive and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quotative division, and different kinds of remainder” (p. 178).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being able to see multiplication with fractions as an extension of whole</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number multiplication is important to student success (Wu, 2001). In their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">case study, Vale and Davies (2007) discuss the connection between</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">foundation to solving fraction problems. Setting up array formations and grids</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for whole number multiplication and division are directly linked to using area </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 39 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">models and grids for calculating fraction multiplication and division. The area</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">model of multiplication provides a visual and allows connections to be made</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">between whole number multiplication and fraction multiplication, and also</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">helps to explain why multiplication of fractions results in a smaller number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(Wu, 2001). The common approach to multiplication draws upon repeatedaddition,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a well-known strategy for whole number multiplication that is more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">difficult to apply to fraction multiplication (e.g., when thinking about</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tsankova and Pjanic (2009) also discuss the area model of multiplication as an</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effective way of linking multiplication with fractions to whole number</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication: “the concept of multiplication applied in finding the area of a</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although division with fractions is significantly different than division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whole numbers (see Section 2: Conceptual Underpinnings for Multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Division with Fractions), according to Kribs-Zaleta (2008), building on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge of division of whole numbers can also help build understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions. In fact, Sidney and Alibali (2012) found that relating the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abstract division structure used in whole number division was more beneficial</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to student learning of division with fractions than was relating knowledge of</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">group is known, and partitive division (fair sharing), which helps you divide</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">items among a known number of groups are two such examples of whole</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number division models. Kribs-Zaleta (2008) worked with a group of sixth </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">graders and found that cutting up oranges and using containers of lemonade</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proved helpful in illustrating models for division of fractions. The following</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">explains the solution process seen in the study:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider the following problem when working through the following steps for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">measurement division: There are 3 meters of ribbon. Each decoration needs</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a meter of ribbon. How many decorations can you make?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For measurement division problems… most solutions involved a twostep</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">process:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Subdivide the dividend into units of the given denominator</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(e.g.,fifths).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Group the new pieces according to the numerator (e.g., two).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Solutions to the partitive problems also tended to involve two steps,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but here the order was reversed…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Partition the dividend into as many groups as the numerator (e.g.,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Build as many of the groups created above as the denominator (e.g.,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">five). (Kribs-Zaleta, 2008, p. 455)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The following sample of student thinking demonstrates the strategy outlined</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">above for measurement division problems. The student has constructed the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">three meters of ribbon, partitioned each meter into fifths and then grouped</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Effective teaching includes multiple and carefully selected representations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for multiplying and dividing fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After working with a group of teachers, Peck and Wood (2008) recognized the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">importance of being able to teach – and respond to – a variety of</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Summary: The meaning of “division of fractions” is the same as the meaning of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“division of whole numbers.” It is an inverse operation of multiplication; that is,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">given the product of two numbers and one of these two numbers, find the other</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(p. 210). Equal groups, multiplicative comparison, repeatedsubtraction/measurement,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and fair-sharing/partitioning are all classifications</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for representing multiplication and division of fractions that are discussed by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peck and Wood (2008). In increasing their own flexibility with representations,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teachers are better able to teach their students a variety of ways to solve</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems in mathematics (Peck &amp; Wood, 2008). Of equal importance is the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">careful selection of representations that are appropriate to the context of the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an effort to help teachers understand both how and why fraction division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">works, Cengiz and Rathouz (2011) suggest using stories, diagrams and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">symbols to: (i) see characteristics of each type of fraction operation; (iI)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recognize differences between them; and, (iii) develop an understanding of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when, and in which context, to use each of them. The authors reported on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two teachers engaged in challenging fractions tasks where they had to move</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">between representations (from “stories to diagrams and symbols” and from</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“symbols to stories and diagrams”), a helpful strategy in making sense of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions. The authors suggest that activities be selected to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provide experiences which help build the concept of the unit and connect</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">representations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider the following example, where a story is represented first as a</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division of fractions in Japan. Two teacher candidates and</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Japanese textbooks and the proportional number line was used as a tool to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">help students and teachers interpret and solve problems. The number line</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">representation helped students think about fraction calculations in several</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Specific suggestions for understanding multiplication with fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Multiplication is a complex operation. Depending on the size of the mutiplier,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication may result in increased, decreased or preserved quantities. Azim</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(2002) found that students perceive multiplication as either repeated addition</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of whole numbers or division (fractions), depending on whether the quantity</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">increases or decreases in size, respectively. Azim identified a number of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">methods that help develop an understanding of multiplication, in all its forms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making real-life connections, for example, to photocopying (where a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">photocopier can preserve, reduce or enlarge an image, depending on the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplier) or increasing/decreasing fractional recipe amounts can help</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students conceptualize how the multiplication of fractions will result in a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">smaller quantity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As previously discussed, we know that based on early experience of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations with whole numbers, students tend to persist in a strongly held</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">belief and overgeneralization that addition and multiplication operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">always produce a larger total or quantity, and when you subtract or divide,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you get a smaller quantity. Graeber and Campbell (1993) reported on student</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">misconceptions and provided suggestions for helping students figure out how</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the opposite can be true, in the case of multiplying and dividing fractions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fractions Operations: Multiplication and Division Literature Review Page 52 of 66</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the common interpretations of multiplication – repeated addition –</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">does not lend itself well to the multiplication of rational numbers (e.g., mixed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">numbers, proper fractions or decimals). Therefore, students should have more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a sense of multiplication than just repeated addition. The area model of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication is helpful for seeing how “multiplication makes smaller.” When</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two fractions of an area are laid on top of each other, the overlapping section</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is the answer. This is very similar to the explanation provided in Section 2 of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this literature review, which discusses the concept of „shared space‟ and has</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proven to be a particularly powerful representation for helping teachers and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">students make sense of fraction multiplication.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an area model, one factor describes the width of a rectangle, the other</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another strategy in understanding how fraction multiplication results in a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">smaller quantity is to identify the pattern in a list of multiplication facts</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beginning with whole numbers and then continuing to fractions less than 1</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The measurement model can help students make sense of “division making</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Graeber and Campbell (1993) suggest that “fraction pieces, drawings, or their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[students‟] knowledge of the monetary system” are helpful in solving division</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bigger (p. 410).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The measurement model and the repeated-subtraction model prove useful in</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eliminating fraction division misconceptions. “The measurement model can be</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">used to reveal the relationship between the answer and the divisor. This</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">model can also build connections with other concepts and models, such as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the division algorithm, remainders, and the missing-factor approach”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(Coughlin, 2010, p. 283). Using repeated subtraction, as shown in the below</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recommendations for supporting high quality research on fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Supporting High Quality Teaching of Fractions Operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Given the particularly troublesome research findings on pre-service</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">teacher understanding of fractions operations, combined with the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reported lack of attention to this content in education programs, it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be beneficial to consider ways to increase the fractions content</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">learning in pre-service programs. This could involve combined efforts of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">faculty who are mathematics educators and Ministry staff to consider</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">innovative ways to support teacher candidates in their learning,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">including opportunities to benefit from online resources of the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EduGAINS site such as the Fractions Digital Paper, CLIPS fractions, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other related online fractions resources.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Similarly, current in-service teachers require professional learning</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">opportunities and high quality resources that are specifically focused on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">content learning of, and related effective pedagogies for, developing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deep student understanding of multiplication and division with</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fractions. This includes an emphasis on the conceptual underpinnings</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that support effective fractions teaching and sustained student learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">District school board educators along with Ministry of Education</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">personnel could collaborate in these efforts using a multipronged and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multi-modal strategy (some online, some face-to-face, a variety of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">offerings of short and longer duration, continued development of, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">implementation of, high quality tasks and lesson materials for teachers).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> As a way forward, educators can review the current best practices</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">described in Section 6 of this literature review.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Supporting High Quality Research on Fractions Operations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just as there are recommendations for improving the teaching of fractions,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there are also recommendations for improving the research on multiplication</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and division with fractions. These include:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Supporting and implementing additional and more robust research at</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the in-service level where the literature is relatively sparse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Continuing to develop the Fractions Learning Pathways Framework to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">include multiplication and division with fractions, and continue</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">developing field-testing and disseminating accessible high caliber</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resources for teachers related to the Fractions Learning Pathways</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Framework.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Engaging in more research on effective teaching of multiplication and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">division with fractions, including seeking answers to questions such as</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the following:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">o How can we tap into students‟ informal knowledge and early</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strategies with fair sharing to help them build deep conceptual</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding that later increases understanding of more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">formalized fractions operations?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">o How can the unit fraction help with the teaching and learning of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">multiplication and division of fractions? How can unit fractions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">help students to understand equivalent fractions and common</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">denominators (which are central to multiplication and division</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with fractions)?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">o Which types of tasks, contexts and representations support</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ontario students most effectively in developing their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding of multiplication and division with fractions?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To pursue any of the above recommendations for research, once again,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">partnerships will be central to success. Researchers, teachers, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mathematics leaders would benefit from working together to gain clear</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and well-informed answers to some of these questions.</span></p>
